After the excellent response to the bot that attends Teams meetings and the bot that attends Zoom meeting, there was no doubt that "almighty" Google applications had to brought into this picture!</p>

Many YouTubers have made a Google Meet bot but, have you seen a bot for Google Classrooms? Well, here we go again!</p>



## Program Prerequisites</h2>


As always, this program, like the others run on Python programming language. So, make sure that you already have Python installed on your PC. If you don't, you can download it through <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Python official website</a>.</p>



## Step 1- Installing the Repository </h2>

We start off by downloading the code/repository from GitHub to get the code on our system. Go to <a href="https://github.com/prokan468/googleclassesautobot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub (click here)</a> and download the ZIP file of the code.</p>

## Step 2- Extracting the File&nbsp;</h2>

Next, extract the file inside to whatever location you want. (I’d&nbsp;suggest desktop simply)&nbsp;</p>


## Step 3- Formatting the 'settings.yaml' file</h2>

Inside the folder, you will see a file named “settings.yaml”. Open this file with a text editor and follow the steps written after the # or watch the YouTube video to properly understand how to input your data.</p>

### Step 3.1- Google Classroom</h3>

Remember that if you want to join your classes on Google Classroom, leave link and code as it is and input the timings and the range. Also the timings should correspond with the order of classes on Google Classroom.</p>


### Step 3.2- Google Meet</h3>

If you want to join a meeting through link on Google Meet, leave code as it is and enter the link corresponding to the timing entered. The same applies to the code.</p>

## Step 4- Running 'requirements.py' in CMD</h2>

Next, in the bar on the file explorer, type 'cmd' and hit enter. CMD will open and there type in 'python requirements.py' and hit enter. This would install all the modules needed for this code to run.</p>

## Step 5- Running the Code </h2>


Now, the only thing left to do is to run the code. Type 'python main.py' and see the magic begin!</p>

The bot will wait for the start time and as soon as it's time for it to run, .....!  </p>

## The End

That is all! When the time comes, the bot will open Google Meet/ Google Classroom and join your class and you can just sit there and relax.</p>
